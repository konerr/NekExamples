This is a simple example of Sod shock tube in 2D.

A diaphragm is initialized at (0,0) in a domain [-1,1] x [0,0.1].

The density ratio across the diaphragm is 8. 

=====
NOTE:
=====

 - The maximum working Courant number for this case is 0.36.

 - The tunable parameter in the EVM, 'c_sub_e' is set to 4.00 in usrdat2.
 
 - Run 'mkdir profiles' to store the thermodynamic, velocity and Entropy Viscosity
   profiles. 

 - Profile files are written for each processor at a given time. To consolidate 
   all these into a single file run catalot.sh in 'profiles' folder. 

   Usage: ./catalot.sh <prefix> <time_stamp>
   Available prefix: rho, rhoe, u, v, T, visc
